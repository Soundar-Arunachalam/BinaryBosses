                The Department of Information Technology was established in the year 1999. It has the vision of “Evolve into a Centre of Excellence for Education and Research in Information Technology” through academic excellence, collaborative research and value added courses to produce highly competent and socially conscious information technology professionals. The Department offers one UG programme BTech in Information Technology since 1999 and one PG programme in Computer Science and Information Security since 2014. The UG programme is accredited by NBA for two years.
                The theme area of the Department is “Data Modelling and Analytics” and it is facilitated by different Special Interest Groups (SIGs) – Data Engineering, Distributed Systems, Mobile Technologies, and Information Security and Management. The Department is supported by well experienced and qualified faculty members. Faculty have been doing research in the areas like Data Analytics, Data Mining, Wireless Sensor Networks, Information Security, Cognitive science, Cloud Computing, etc. The Department has active Student Chapters in Professional Bodies like Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), IEEE-SMC and ISACA and is involved in organizing events like guest lectures, workshops and project contests.
                The Department has established Industry linkage with various companies like Honeywell, IBM, CTS, Zebra Technologies, XEROX, DELL, GT-NEXUS, EMC2, and Microsoft. It has industry supported Enterprise Mobility Lab by Zebra technologies (Motorola). Both students and faculty have been trained in contemporary areas and for industrial solutions. 90% placement is maintained consistently every year.
                Many of our Alumnus do higher studies in global Universities like University of Sydney, Collarado, Illinois, Cincinatti and so on. Apart from specialized knowledge and skills, the association programmes conducted by the Department aim to develop all round personality by inculcating values of truthfulness, genuineness, team spirit and vibrant work culture.
